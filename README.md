## Overview

This project is for a single page Vue application called Geo Info, it allows a user to search for geographical information using a valid postcode

## Project setup

IDE used to develop: VS Code version 1.85.1

The project was developed on a Windows machine using Vue CLI using the settings:

Vue 2.6.14
npm package manager

Using the following tools:
ESLint
babel

With the following VS Code extensions installed:
Prettier - code formatter
Vue 3 Snippets
Vue Language Features (Volar)
TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)


```
To get up and running, please check your node.js version and switch to/install version 18.17.0 if needed 
You can do this by running the following commands in the IDE terminal:

node --version
nvm install 18.17.0
nvm use 18.17.0


then run the following

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

This should return a local host link for previewing the app, if there are issues I found adjusting my execution policy (shouldn't be an issue on work issued macs) and running installation for the Vue CLI helped, the cmd for this is

npm install -g @vue/cli


### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
